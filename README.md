# configs
These are configuration files for the tools I use. More may be added later. I use Buster but mose functions and aliases should also work for debian derivatives and other distros. I've grouped and commented similar changes. Settings I don't usually use are commented out or deleted.


**Bash**
* Aliases for faster direcotry changes, editing /etc/hosts, python interactive mode, firejail with special flags, and git commands
* Automatic piping to less for package searches
* Automatic setup or flushing of iptables (firewall) settings with the wall() function
* Android debug bridge functions for faster pushing and pulling
* Vim plugin environement variables

**Vim**
* Remaps for faster window movment in vim and gvim 
* Vertical terminal command (:Ter)
* CtrlP, Buffergator, and NerdTree shortcuts for buffer switching and directory movement
* Better line numbering and page positioning (c-n, c-m, <leader>w/e)
* Vim-airline symbols
